# adaptive-shield-assignment

Repository for the home assessment for AdaptiveShield.

Some things you should take note of:

- The result mapping of collateral adjectives to animals will be found in the RESULT.txt file.
- Images will be saved to the /tmp directory. I implemented the image downloading function to use 4 threads. The (honest) reason is that I tried 2 threads and it still felt too slow. Could ramp it up if need be but this works nicely for now.
